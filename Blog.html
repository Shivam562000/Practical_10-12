        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Data Analysis</h1>
        <p>Data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information for business decision-making. The purpose of 
            Data Analysis is to extract useful information from data and taking the decision based upon the data analysis. Whenever we take any decision in our day-to-day 
            life is by thinking about what happened last time or what will happen by choosing that particular decision. This is nothing but analyzing our past or future 
            and making decisions based on it. For that, we gather memories of our past or dreams of our future. So that is nothing but data analysis. Now same thing analyst 
            does for business purposes, is called Data Analysis.</p>
        <p>
            Data analysis tools make it easier for users to process and manipulate data, analyze the relationships and correlations between data sets, and it also helps to 
            identify patterns and trends for interpretation. Here is a complete list of tools.</p>
        <p>Once the data is collected, cleaned, and processed, it is ready for Analysis. As you manipulate data, you may find you have the exact information you need, or 
            you might need to collect more data. During this phase, you can use data analysis tools and software which will help you to understand, interpret, and derive 
            conclusions based on the requirements.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. 
            The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
            </p>
            The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal
            When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave 
            stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.
            Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, 
            from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.
            As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic functions 
            or recognize text through optimal character recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for 
            granted as an inherent computer function.
        <p>The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested 
            and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.Other 
            examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the 
            consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, 
            the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.</p>
